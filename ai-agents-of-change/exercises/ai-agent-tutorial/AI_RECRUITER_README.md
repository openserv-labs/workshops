## The Three Personas

### 1. Bias Revealer: Exposing Problematic Recruitment Patterns

**Capabilities:**
- Analyzes resumes to identify areas where bias commonly manifests
- Generates questions that demonstrate subtle and explicit forms of discrimination including:
  - Gender bias (e.g., questioning commitment based on perceived gender)
  - Academic elitism (e.g., university prestige over actual skills)
  - Age discrimination (devaluing experience or assuming technological incompetence)
  - Cultural bias (assumptions about work style based on background)
  - Credential fixation (overemphasizing formal credentials while ignoring demonstrated skills)
- Explains how these biased questions might impact diverse candidates
- Identifies how AI systems can perpetuate and amplify human biases in hiring

**Value Provided:**
- Raises awareness of how seemingly "neutral" questions can contain harmful assumptions
- Demonstrates how algorithmic bias in AI can reproduce historical hiring patterns
- Helps recruiters recognize and avoid questions that may violate equal opportunity guidelines
- Creates understanding of how biased questions lead to homogeneous teams and missed talent

### 2. Toxic Positivity Detector: Uncovering Unhealthy Workplace Expectations

  - Under-compensation justified through "mission-driven" language
