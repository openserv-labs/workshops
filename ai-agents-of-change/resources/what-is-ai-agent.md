# What is an AI Agent?

Based on our recent DevInsights interview, an AI agent is more than just an algorithmic tool—it's an autonomous system designed to accomplish specific tasks reliably and consistently.

A good agent, as discussed in the interview, is one that does what you ask it to do reliably every single time." This means understanding not just what users explicitly request, but what they implicitly expect. The distinction between what users say they want and what they actually expect is crucial for agent development.

> A good agent is one that does what a user expects and delivers reliable results every single time.

For instance, a DexScreener agent should consistently provide the top five tokens based on specified parameters, not just random selections that require independent verification. Similarly, an image generation agent should accurately produce visuals matching requested styles and scenes—failing to do so creates frustration and diminishes trust.

## The Challenge of Building Good Agents

Creating effective agents involves several complex challenges:

1. **Understanding user intent beyond explicit instructions** - Interpreting what users genuinely expect rather than just processing their literal requests

2. **Producing the right conditions for desired outcomes** - Setting up the appropriate parameters and frameworks to enable success

3. **Ensuring outputs align with expectations** - Implementing validation systems to verify that results match what users actually want

This complexity necessitates sophisticated feedback loops and validation systems, which is where OpenServ provides significant value.
