# Multi-Agent Systems

![AI Agent Design Architecture](ai-agent-design-architecture.png)

## Why Use Multiple Agents?

As Armagan explains in the course materials:

> "The mental model is therefore entirely different. In a UI application, you have maybe some state, some deterministic state that you show to the user... The possible scenarios or the possible space of the state representation is really tiny. Whereas when you're building an AI agent, inherently that space becomes infinite."

By combining multiple specialized agents, we can:

1. **Divide Cognitive Load**: Each agent handles what it's best at
2. **Enable Parallel Processing**: Multiple tasks can happen simultaneously
3. **Create Emergent Behavior**: The whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts

## Agent Types in a Multi-Agent System

- **Expert Agents**: Domain-specific knowledge and skills
- **Coordinator Agents**: Orchestrate workflows between agents
- **Memory Agents**: Store and retrieve information
- **Critic Agents**: Evaluate outputs and provide feedback
