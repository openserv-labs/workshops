# AI Agents & Ethics Considerations

AI isn't just about code - it's about consequences. Every agent we build could impact jobs, perpetuate biases, or create social value.


## The Responsibility

AI creators inherit ethical obligations often before writing any code. The development and deployment of AI agents raise concerns related to bias, transparency, accountability, and privacy.

Many of the considerations we had before when building models, having to deal with the fact that data is biased, that humes expect some level of privacy and transparency on how decisions are made. 




## Impact Spectrum

 AI agents exist on a spectrum with respect to good or bad, from social good enablers (healthcare diagnistics) to job disruptors (automated hiring systmes). 

 The ethical considerations of AI systems are not always that straightforward. For example: 


One dimension which is coming into focus with AI Agents is accountability, especially when AI agents operate autonomously. Here comes the need to implement human oversight .. However, one of the main goals of deploying AI agents is to cut down on human input. In such cases, how can you maintain human oversight while still reducing manual intervention? 


When it comes to costs, AI agents consume more energy and resources as well.

> one user wondered aloud on X how much electricity is burned up by people saying "please" and "thank you" to OpenAI's ChatGPT. In response, CEO Sam Altman admitted it costs the super lab millions of dollars in operational expenses - money that he nonetheless believes is worth it.

and the response..

>> "Tens of millions of dollars well spent," Altman said, adding that "you never know" when being nice to an AI chatbot might be a good idea.

What is your opinion on this?

## Mitigation Framework

In order to help you consider various ethical issues we will use the AI Ethics Canvas Framework. The AI Ethics Canvas developed by [Trystan S. Goetze](https://www.trystangoetze.ca/aicanvas.html) will walk you and your team through the steps for thinking about the different AI ethics issues that are relevant to you.

Your agent isn't neutral - it encodes your choices about who benefits and who bears risks, your choices about the resources it uses..
